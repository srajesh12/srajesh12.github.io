    Bio:

    I am from Sunnyvale, CA. I am a rising senior at Fremont High School and am currently attending the 2019 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Intuit Building 9 in Mountain View, CA. I live with my mom, dad, and my younger sister. What I enjoy doing outside of coding is listening to music.
    </p>

    <p>
    Likes: I enjoy listening to music, studying, and dance parties.
    </p>

    <p>
    Dislikes: I hate long lines, flights longer than 9 hours and car rides longer than 5 hours. They bore and tire me out!
    </p>

    <p>
    Fun Fact: I was born in California and stayed for 8 months, then moved to Pennsylvania and stayed there for 11 years, then moved to California. Now I have lived in California for 5 years.
    </p>

    <p>
    Interesting Fact: Moving from Pennsylvania to California was a major move. It was a major change mainly because of the weather. In Pennsylvania, rain used to come more often than in California. Also, Pennsylvania used to get snow every winter. In California, there is no snow. This was also a major advantage of moving to California.
